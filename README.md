# ðŸª™ Rinxo â€” Your Crypto Wallet

**Rinxo** is a frontend-only crypto wallet interface, commissioned by **Youthistan** as part of a redesign effort for their platform. It was also built as my friend's final year project, with the UI and development handled by me.

### ðŸ§© Features

* Tracks live **Bitcoin prices** using the **CoinGecko API**
* Clean, modern UI built with a responsive layout
* Static chart components (mocked data; backend would be required for real-time updates)
* Prices displayed are **real-time and accurate**, but chart visualizations are placeholders

This project focused primarily on frontend design and functionality. Backend integration was out of scope, but the structure allows for future extension.
